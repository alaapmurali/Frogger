This game is like "Cross the Road", except with a frog crossing a river. The objective is to make the frog cross the river and touch one of the mushroom houses without getting hit by a log flowing down the river. Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move the frog. Press "Enter" to start the game and to restart the game after you lose. To play again after you win, press "Select". Pressing the "Select" button at anytime during the game will take you back to the home screen.
